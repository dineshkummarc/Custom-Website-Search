Adds a document to this index. If the document contains more than <a href="Lucene.Net.Index.IndexWriter.SetMaxFieldLength.html">SetMaxFieldLength</a> terms for a given field, the remainder are discarded.  Note that if an Exception is hit (for example disk full) then the index will be consistent, but this document may not have been added. Furthermore, it's possible the index will have one segment in non-compound format even when using compound files (when a merge has partially succeeded). This method periodically flushes pending documents to the Directory (see <a href="#flush" xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">above</a>), and also periodically triggers segment merges in the index according to the <a href="Lucene.Net.Index.IndexWriter.MergePolicy.html">MergePolicy</a> in use.Merges temporarily consume space in the directory. The amount of space required is up to 1X the size of all segments being merged, when no readers/searchers are open against the index, and up to 2X the size of all segments being merged when readers/searchers are open against the index (see <a href="Lucene.Net.Index.IndexWriter.Optimize1.html">Optimize</a> for details). The sequence of primitive merge operations performed is governed by the merge policy. Note that each term in the document can be no longer than 16383 characters, otherwise an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.Note that it's possible to create an invalid Unicode string in java if a UTF16 surrogate pair is malformed. In this case, the invalid characters are silently replaced with the Unicode replacement character U+FFFD.<b xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">NOTE</b>: if this method hits an OutOfMemoryError you should immediately close the writer.

This method is transactional in how Exceptions are handled: it does not commit a new segments_N file until all indexes are added. This means if an Exception occurs (for example disk full), then either no indexes will have been added or they all will have been.Note that this requires temporary free space in the Directory up to 2X the sum of all input indexes (including the starting index). If readers/searchers are open against the starting index, then temporary free space required will be higher by the size of the starting index (see <a href="Lucene.Net.Index.IndexWriter.Optimize1.html">Optimize</a> for details). Once this completes, the final size of the index will be less than the sum of all input index sizes (including the starting index).

Note that this does not wait for any running background merges to finish. This may be a costly operation, so you should test the cost in your application and do it only when really necessary. Note that this operation calls Directory.sync on the index files. That call should not return until the file contents &amp; metadata are on stable storage. For FSDirectory, this calls the OS's fsync.

Requests an "optimize" operation on an index, priming the index for the fastest available search. Traditionally this has meant merging all segments into a single segment as is done in the default merge policy, but individaul merge policies may implement optimize in different ways. It is recommended that this method be called upon completion of indexing. In environments with frequent updates, optimize is best done during low volume times, if at all. See http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/47895 for more discussion. Note that optimize requires 2X the index size free space in your Directory (3X if you're using compound file format). For example, if your index size is 10 MB then you need 20 MB free for optimize to complete (30 MB if you're using compound fiel format).If some but not all readers re-open while an optimize is underway, this will cause &gt; 2X temporary space to be consumed as those new readers will then hold open the partially optimized segments at that time. It is best not to re-open readers while optimize is running.The actual temporary usage could be much less than these figures (it depends on many factors).In general, once the optimize completes, the total size of the index will be less than the size of the starting index. It could be quite a bit smaller (if there were many pending deletes) or just slightly smaller.If an Exception is hit during optimize(), for example due to disk full, the index will not be corrupt and no documents will have been lost. However, it may have been partially optimized (some segments were merged but not all), and it's possible that one of the segments in the index will be in non-compound format even when using compound file format. This will occur when the Exception is hit during conversion of the segment into compound format.This call will optimize those segments present in the index when the call started. If other threads are still adding documents and flushing segments, those newly created segments will not be optimized unless you call optimize again.<b xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">NOTE</b>: if this method hits an OutOfMemoryError you should immediately close the writer.

Note that if flushing by document count is also enabled, then the flush will be triggered by whichever comes first.<b xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">NOTE</b>: the account of RAM usage for pending deletions is only approximate. Specifically, if you delete by Query, Lucene currently has no way to measure the RAM usage if individual Queries so the accounting will under-estimate and you should compensate by either calling commit() periodically yourself, or by using <a href="Lucene.Net.Index.IndexWriter.SetMaxBufferedDeleteTerms.html">SetMaxBufferedDeleteTerms</a> to flush by count instead of RAM usage (each buffered delete Query counts as one). <b xmlns="urn:ndoc-schema">NOTE</b>: because IndexWriter uses <code>int</code>s when managing its internal storage, the absolute maximum value for this setting is somewhat less than 2048 MB. The precise limit depends on various factors, such as how large your documents are, how many fields have norms, etc., so it's best to set this value comfortably under 2048.  The default value is <a href="Lucene.Net.Index.IndexWriter.DEFAULT_RAM_BUFFER_SIZE_MB.html">DEFAULT_RAM_BUFFER_SIZE_MB</a>. enabled but non-positive, or it disables ramBufferSize when maxBufferedDocs is already disabled </td></tr>
